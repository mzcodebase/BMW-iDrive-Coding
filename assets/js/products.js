      "US versions of i3s are much more limited in how they use their gas engines compared to the European versions, but with BMW i3 REx coding you can display your i3's true fuel level â€” up to an extra half-gallon over the electronically limited reading! When on top of that we activate a Range extender option in the menu you'll be able to turn on the 'hold battery charge' mode, which will make your car conserve the battery energy and rely heavily on the gasoline engine first. Driving on gas should not only be far more practical during longer trips, but also suply your i3 with more power when bigger power demands are upcoming â€“ like going uphill. <br/><br/>" +
      "Remember that the Range extender option is something you can activate or deactivate it any time you want.<br/><br/>" +
      "So, if you think your i3 REx that could use some adjustments of the tank capacity and Hold mode, i3 REx coding is your go to choice. And all you need to have it programmed is a coding cable and a scheduled remote coding session with our BimmerTech technician. Do that and weâ€™ll take it from there!",
